"""
Implements a custom auth backend as described in the Django docs. Notably authentication could be provided by the
default Django backend, but authorization (i.e. permissions checking) must be handled by our custom backends since we
do not use the regular Django permissions. See handling authorization docs. Should then be listed in the
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS. Note that authentication backends are checked in the order they're listed.
